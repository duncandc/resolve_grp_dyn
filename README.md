#RESOLVE Project

This directory contains code and data for a project on measureing the relation between halo mass and galaxy properties in the RESOLVE survey.

If you are running any code in this repo, you should add the location of this directory to your python path.  You will need to compile the group finder.  Directions on how to do this are inside the group_finder directory.

You will also need to install Halotools.
